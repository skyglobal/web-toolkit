========================

**Deprecated: Please use [sky-uk/toolkit](https://github.com/sky-uk/toolkit).**

--

> Sky branded CSS, JavaScript utilities, and UI components.

> Save time by using the toolkit to set your base styles. Create Sky styled headings and buttons within seconds.

> The toolkit can also help you quickly build robust components like accordions and carousels.

> Business descriptions of component functionality is visible from directly within the demo site (created from the actual unit-test reports)

## Getting Started

This project contains the code to generate the `toolkit` files, e.g. `toolkit.js` + `toolkit.css`.
The code to generate the [demo site](http://skyglobal.github.io/web-toolkit/) is also here.

### Prerequisites

To build the toolkit locally, you'll need to install:
 * [ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/) (version 1.9.3 or later),
 * [node.js](http://nodejs.org),
 * [npm](https://www.npmjs.org),
 * [grunt cli](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started),
 * [Bundler](http://bundler.io)

To check you have these tools with the correct versions, run:
 * `which node && which npm && which grunt && which ruby && which bundle`
 * `bundle check && npm update`

### Setup

Clone the repository and install the dependencies

```bash
git clone https://github.com/skyglobal/web-toolkit.git
cd web-toolkit
git remote add upstream https://github.com/skyglobal/web-toolkit.git
npm install
bundle install
```

### Building/Running the Toolkit

Update the toolkit by making your change and testing it within the demo site.

 * `grunt server` : Grunt will spin up the [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/github-pages/) server, watch for code changes and rebuild on the fly.
 * `grunt server --beautify` : To help when debugging.
 * `grunt test` : Runs the unit tests in [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/)
 * `grunt test-cross-browser` : Runs the unit tests using multiple browsers remotely.
 * `grunt fonts` : Only needed to rebuild the Icon Fonts (skycons).
 * `grunt build-js` : Just build the JS.

Please help us out by contributing any changes you make locally back into the source project. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

For more details about the available commands please see [grunt/README.md](./grunt#web-toolkit-grunt)

## Code Overview

The repository contains two main components; the Web Toolkit and the demo site.

*  Sass files are in [`app/src/sass`](./app/src/sass) and compiled output is saved into [`dist/stylesheets`](./_site/dist/stylesheets)
*  JavaScript code is in [`app/src/js`](./app/src/js) and contains four modules which are output to [`_site/dist/scripts`](./_site/dist/scripts)
  *  `toolkit` contains the JS utilities and toolkit UI components code
  *  `demo` provides demo support for the website
  *  `changes` provides support for the changes page of the website
  *  `testIframe` provides support for running unit tests online on the website
* HTML files are in [`app/_includes`](./app/_includes)
*  Skycons are in the [`app/static/font-svgs`](./app/static/font-svgs) and minified into [`grunt/fonts/min`](./grunt/fonts/min).

## Feature Requests + Bugs

Please take a look through currently open and closed issues to see if your feature/bug has already been discussed.  If not, feel free to open new issues and let us know about any bugs that you find.

This project is currently maintained out of the hard work from a very few contributers who are working on other projects at the same time. If you could write any updates and submit pull requests (see [Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md)) this would be amazing (and you would get your request looked at much faster!).
