### Separating Components

> We are now breaking the toolkit up into smaller chunks.
> The aim of this is to make it simpler, easier and quicker to contribute, add enhancements and fix bugs.
> As a bonus, this will allow us to play with new techonolgoies without worrying about breaking everything!

## All we ask is:

* Use the helper to create standard gulp tasks - this will be a mssive time saver!
   * https://github.com/skyglobal/gulp-sky-component-helper
* A demopage using gh-pages branch is visible 
   * i.e. skyglobal.github.io/component-name
* The component is tested and can be run locally 
   * `gulp test`
* The component will be available on bower  
* The component will be available via CDN
* Please, no mention of `toolkit`!
