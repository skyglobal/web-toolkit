<p>Responsive Images uses javascript to show different images for different screen sizes. For images to display as fast as possible, this is included as a separate JS function that you must copy and paste at the top of your page.
    You can then call the <code>init</code> function inline, after creating the element. The toolkit javascript will take care of handling screen resizing.</p>
