        Responsive Images uses javascript to show different images for different screen sizes.
        For images to display as fast as possible, this is included as a separate JS function that you must copy and paste at the top of your page.
        You can then call the <code>init</code> function inline, after creating the element.
        The toolkit javascript will take care of handling screen resizing.

        This function does not rely on jQuery, which means it can be included inline before any blocking JS has been downloaded.
        This helps for better performance through a faster load of responsive images.
